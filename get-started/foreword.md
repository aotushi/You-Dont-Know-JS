# 你不知道的 JS: 开始 - 第 2 版

# 前言

第一次我看见推特为*你不知道的 JS*原创书籍进行广告众筹活动, 我心里想无论这个 Kyle Simpson 是谁,他都可以去死了.我当然知道JavaScript!当时我已经在JavaScript领域和一些科技界的明显大腕工作了好多年, 所以我对这种说法嗤之以鼻.


这本书的众筹完成后, 我看到很多人为了读这本书是非常兴奋的并且我也决定瞅一瞅-你知道的, 仅仅是向大家证明我 *不懂* javascript.

So it turned out I didn't know JavaScript. I didn't know why I had adopted certain patterns; I didn't know why JavaScript behaves the way it does in certain situations, and I didn't know much of the nuance of the languages that I assumed I did. Many were things I didn't know I didn't know, and I was worse off as a developer for it.

This is what this book series is great for. It's not just for someone picking up the language for the first time (though it's for them, too); it's for all software craftspeople who want to master their tools, who want to understand the ins and outs of their trade, and who want to select the proper methods for solving problems.

The thing I appreciate about Kyle and his work is that he is delightfully uninfluenced by the zeitgeist of the programming world around him. That isn't to say he isn't aware of what's happening in the community but rather that it doesn't sway his pursuit of the best answers to the correct questions. This often has put him at odds with the latest "best practices," but in reality this is exactly what you need: a perspective removed from temporal influence and simply speaking to the underlying truth. That's why this series is so good. The first edition of _You Don't Know JS_ is still accurate, years later! Not many things stand this test of time given the shifting sands of the JavaScript landscape.

Let's talk a moment about this first book itself, _Get Started_. You may be tempted to skip it as you may think that you already have "gotten started," but it's worth reading this one! You'd be surprised how much depth, nuance, and oddity there is in the underlying building blocks of JavaScript, and it's quite essential for you to grapple with these underpinnings before venturing forward into the constructs of the language. It's exactly the sort of foundation you need, to really know JavaScript.

So, do your future self a favor and dig into this book and unlock the knowledge within. These solid foundations will serve you better than any framework ever will; those come and go but we'll still be writing JavaScript itself for decades to come. Keep an open mind and challenge your preconceived notions.

Because, as I found out myself, you probably don't know JavaScript (yet).
